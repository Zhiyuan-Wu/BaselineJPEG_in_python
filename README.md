# JPEG Decoder in Python

This is a python implementation of baseline JPEG decoder, as a programming homework for Lesson Advanced Signal Processing.

This code is mainly from Yasoob Khalid's excellent blog, by replacing Huffman Tree and IDCT with better implementation, and adding support to sub-sampling case like 420.
